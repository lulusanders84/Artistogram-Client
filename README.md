## Artistogram

https://artistogram-client.herokuapp.com/

With Artistogram users can enter an artist or band's name and then view a graphical representation of similar artists sorted by decade. 
Users can then create a playlist comprised of songs by the similar artists. By creating an account, users can save artistograms and
playlists for later use.
